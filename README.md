# Semantic-Segmentation
This project is about semantic segmentation. It is the final project of Machine Learning in NYCU. This course is a cooperative course with MediaTek. Because of the confidentiality of the company, sorry for that I can't provide the code and more detail about this project.

## Introduction
In this project, we need to design a lightweight DL semantic segmentation model suitable for constrained embedded system design to deal with traffic scenes in Asian countries like Taiwan. We focus on

- Segmantic accuracy
- Power consumption
- Real-time performance
- The deployment on MTK

## Sample
